# Noise-engine

The **Noise-engine** module, implemented in Rust, serves as a specialized component for generating procedural noise functions integral to the **Cactus** Minecraft server. This project is tailored to address the computational and algorithmic requirements of Minecraft's world generation, with a concentrated focus on noise types essential for creating diverse and dynamic environments.

## Features

- **Domain-Specific Noise Generation**: Incorporates algorithms specifically optimized for Minecraft terrain and structural generation, ensuring relevance and precision.
- **Server-Centric Optimization**: Designed for seamless integration with server operations, eliminating superfluous dependencies to maximize efficiency.
- **High-Performance Execution**: Leverages Rustâ€™s capabilities to deliver low-latency computations and optimal memory utilization, thereby sustaining server performance under load.

## Installation

This module is engineered for direct integration into the **Cactusserver** codebase. It is not structured as a standalone library and is intended solely for internal use within the server's architecture.

## Future Objectives

- **Selective Noise Implementation**: Focused development of noise algorithms that are specifically applicable to Minecraft world generation, including those governing biomes, subterranean formations, and topographical features.
- **Enhanced Computational Efficiency**: Continued refinement of processing routines to ensure minimal performance overhead during real-time server operations.
- **Empirical Validation**: Comprehensive testing under practical conditions to ensure robustness and fidelity in generated outputs.

## Contributions

Given its specialized role as a server-integrated module, contributions from external developers are not actively solicited. Nonetheless, constructive feedback and suggestions are welcomed via the issue tracker.
