# TODO List for a Minecraft-Like Terrain Generator in Rust

## 1. Define Objectives and Requirements
- **Features:**
  - Global terrain generation (overall elevation)
  - Local detail (surface variations)
  - Biome transitions and optionally cave systems
- **Technical Constraints:**
  - Chunk dimensions (e.g., 16×16 blocks horizontally with a fixed vertical height)
  - Memory management (chunk caching, on-demand generation)
  - Server integration (protocol, networking, etc.)
- **Output Format:**
  - How to represent the world (e.g., a 3D array of block types)
  - Block types (Air, Grass, Dirt, Stone, Water, etc.)

## 2. Research and Select Noise Algorithms
- Study noise algorithms such as Perlin and Simplex.
- Understand Fractal Brownian Motion (fBm) to combine multiple octaves.
- Define parameters like frequency, amplitude, persistence, number of octaves, and scaling factors.

## 3. Set Up Your Rust Project
- Create a new project with Cargo.
- Add necessary dependencies in `Cargo.toml` (e.g., the `noise` crate).
- Set up version control (Git).

## 4. Implement Basic Noise Generation
- Write a simple prototype to generate noise values.
- Use a scaling factor to avoid sampling only on integer coordinates.
- Test with a fixed seed for reproducibility.

## 5. Implement Fractal Brownian Motion (fBm)
- Create a function to combine multiple noise octaves.
- Adjust parameters (octaves, persistence, etc.) and test the results.

## 6. Map Noise to Terrain Height
- Convert normalized noise values (e.g., from -1 to 1) to block heights.
- Define a mapping strategy (for example, scaling to a maximum height).

## 7. Design the Chunk Data Structure
- Decide on chunk dimensions (e.g., 16×16×128).
- Create a simple structure to represent blocks (using enums or similar).

## 8. Generate Chunks Based on Noise
- For each (x, z) coordinate in a chunk:
  - Calculate the noise value.
  - Map it to a terrain height.
  - Fill in blocks based on the height (e.g., surface, sub-surface, stone).
- Keep the code modular and avoid overcomplicating early on.

## 9. Test and Visualize the Generated Terrain
- Write unit tests for noise functions and terrain mapping.
- Create a simple visualization (e.g., a 2D height map printed to the console or exporting data for external tools).
- Verify that parameter adjustments produce the expected variations.

## 10. Integrate the Generator into Your Server Architecture
- Implement on-demand chunk generation as the player moves.
- Cache generated chunks (in memory or on disk) to avoid re-computation.
- Consider multithreading or asynchronous processing for parallel generation.

## 11. Optimize and Refine
- Profile the terrain generation for performance bottlenecks.
- Fine-tune noise parameters and mapping logic.
- Plan future enhancements (biomes, caves, advanced block types).

## 12. Document and Maintain the Codebase
- Document your functions, parameters, and overall architecture.
- Use version control to track changes and manage iterative improvements.
- Keep your code modular for easy future enhancements.
